Register new members and store personal information (name, email, phone).
Update the return status when books are returned, and adjust availability accordingly.
Maintain accurate inventory by adjusting the number of copies when books are issued/returned.

Technologies

MySQL or PostgreSQL: Relational databases to store books, members, and transactions.
